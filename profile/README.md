# Scalable Infrastructure for Validation of Computational Social Science Research

A scalable framework that enables agencies to provide access to computational environments consistent with their internal systems and privacy-preserving data that allow researchers to develop and test their analyses. Researchers seeking surrogate access will use
the public-facing SIVACOR system to execute their analysis, generating a certified record of successful execution. The certificate assures researchers that their models are likely to run when submitted to the agency, and provides assurances to the agency that the code provided by researchers is likely to require minimal effort to validate against the confidential data.
